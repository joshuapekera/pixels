# AsyncDisplayKit

Welcome to the AsyncDisplayKit beta!  Documentation — including this README — will be fleshed out for the initial public release.  Until then, please direct questions and feedback to the [Paper Engineering Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/551597518288687) group.

## Installation

AsyncDisplayKit will be available on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/).  You can manually include it in your project's Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'AsyncDisplayKit', :git => 'git@github.com:facebook/AsyncDisplayKit.git'
```

## Usage

```objective-c
#import <AsyncDisplayKit/ASDisplayNode.h>
```

## Testing

AsyncDisplayKit has extensive unit test coverage.  You'll need to run `pod install` in the root AsyncDisplayKit directory to set up OCMock.
